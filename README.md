# Twitter Bot
GUI Twitter bot using Twitter API and Tweepy library on Python. Functionality includes liking, retweeting, and tweeting on a particular search criteria, for a given number of tweets.

# Note
In order for the user to use this GUI app, the user will have to register as a developer account on twitter if it has not already been done so. The authorization keys will need to be filled out in the code. The empty quotes have been noted with comments as to where the authorization keys should go.

Also keep in mind the number of tweets the bot is used upon to not get your account restricted or suspended. Check https://developer.twitter.com/en for more information on how many requests can be made to the API.
